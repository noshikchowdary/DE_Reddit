# Reddit Data Pipeline Architecture

## System Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our Reddit data pipeline, which is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and production-ready.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Reddit API Integration**
  - Custom API client for data extraction
  - Rate limiting and error handling
  - Data validation and quality checks

### 2. Orchestration Layer
- **Apache Airflow**
  - DAG-based workflow management
  - Task scheduling and monitoring
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms
  - SLA monitoring

### 3. Processing Layer
- **Data Processing**
  - Raw data storage in S3
  - Data transformation using AWS Glue
  - SQL-based processing with Amazon Athena
  - Data quality checks and validation

### 4. Storage Layer
- **Data Storage**
  - PostgreSQL for metadata and state management
  - S3 for raw and processed data
  - Redshift for analytics and reporting

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- **Observability**
  - Airflow task monitoring
  - Custom metrics collection
  - Error tracking and alerting
  - Performance monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Data Extraction**
   ```
   Reddit API → Airflow DAG → S3 Raw Data
   ```

2. **Data Processing**
   ```
   S3 Raw Data → AWS Glue → S3 Processed Data
   ```

3. **Data Loading**
   ```
   S3 Processed Data → Amazon Athena → Redshift
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
